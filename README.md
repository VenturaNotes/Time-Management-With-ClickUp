## Description
This script introduces a time management technique designed to replace traditional time blocking. Instead of assigning specific time intervals for tasks (e.g., exercising from 4 PM to 5 PM), the approach relies on the duration of a task.

New Look!

Line #1: Time left on current running task (59 minutes) and the time expected to be finished (7:26PM)

Line #2: Time left of current day (5 hours and 33 minutes)

Line #3: Time behind schedule (10 hours and 26 minutes) OR spare time if you're not overburden with tasks

Line #4: Sum of time estimation for tasks (135.0 hours), days left until tasks due (9.23 days), time needed to work to stay on track (14.63 hours per day)

Line #5: Time on track to doing 12 hours of work a day (can be customized in code to more or less hours expected a day)

The tasks analyzed need to have a due date in the future. Tasks / subtasks currently being worked on need to be tagged "today".

## Final Thoughts
Unfortunately, ClickUp's time tracking feature is no longer available on their "Free Forever" plan. The $7 monthly "Limited" tier is now required for this script to be functional. I plan to create a free standalone application in the near future, but for now, I apologize for this change.
